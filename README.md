## 💡 Why this plugin exists

Many workflows share the same problem: tasks live in one place, the calendar in another, time tracking in a third, and finances and reports are compiled manually in spreadsheets. As a result, the same data has to be entered multiple times.

**This plugin solves exactly that pain point.** It doesn't just add another calendar or tracker. It connects planning, execution, and analysis into a single system:
- A single task updates the calendar.
- The calendar drives time tracking.
- Time spent calculates income.
- Income generates automatic analytics.
- **Mobile experience:** work with tasks from your phone in Obsidian without the usual friction.

---

## 🚀 Who is this for

- **Freelancers and developers** who need to calculate work costs based on hourly rates.
- **Designers and consultants** managing multiple projects simultaneously.
- **Students and researchers** who need to link deadlines, habits, and productivity.
- **Automation enthusiasts** who want the system to work for them (notifications, reports).

<summary><h3>🔗 Sync and Integrations (click to expand)</h3></summary>

### New Data Storage Format
The plugin can store data in JSON format in the `calendar-data/` folder at the root of your vault. When "Sync to vault root" is enabled, it becomes the primary data storage format, ensuring fast loading and data sync via:
- **WebDAV** (Yandex.Disk, OneDrive, etc.)
- **Obsidian Sync** / **Remotely Save**
- **iCloud** / **Google Drive**

> [!NOTE]
> Optional sync with `.md` files (via the "Tasks plugin sync" setting) is intended for compatibility with the [Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) and [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugins.

> [!WARNING] Financial data
> If you track finances in the plugin and use cloud sync, income and expense data will be stored in plain text in the cloud. It is recommended to use abstract project names or exclude the `calendar-data/` folder from syncing.

### External Calendars (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar)
1. Create a [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (classic) with the `gist` scope.
2. Paste the token into the plugin settings and click **"Sync"**.
3. The plugin will create a Gist with an `.ics` file and provide a link.
4. Add this link to your calendar via the "Subscribe from URL" feature.

### Tasks Plugin Format Integration (Optional)
When the "Tasks plugin sync" setting is enabled, the plugin creates `.md` files for tasks so they are visible in the Tasks and Dataview plugins. This is an **additional** feature — primary storage remains in JSON. Example of a generated file:
```markdown
---
task_id: abc123
title: Buy milk
status: todo
date: day-2024-10-25
priority: medium
---
- [ ] Buy milk 📅 2024-10-25 🛫 14:30 🔼
```
*(Supported statuses: `- [ ]` todo, `- [/]` progress, `- [-]` paused, `- [x]` done)*

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>🔔 Notifications (click to expand)</h3></summary>

The plugin has a built-in notification system so you don't miss important events.

| Type | When it triggers |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Local (browser)** | N minutes before start, when overdue, when time limit is exceeded, on the deadline day. |
| **To smartphone (ntfy.sh)** | Duplicate notifications to your phone. Works even when Obsidian is closed. |

### Setting up ntfy.sh

A simple way to get notifications on your phone:
1. Install the [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh/) app on your phone.
2. Enable **ntfy.sh** in the plugin settings and set a topic.
3. Subscribe to this topic in the app.

> [!CAUTION] Security
> Use a unique topic (e.g., a generated UUID like `a7f9b2c4-8e1d-4f3a-9c5b-2d6e8f0a1b3c`) so no one else can subscribe to your notifications. The plugin only sends triggers ("Overdue: Task Name"), not financial data or full texts.
